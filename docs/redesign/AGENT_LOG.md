# AGENT_LOG.md — Strategist ↔ Terminal Agent shared channel

**Purpose.** Async, append-only coordination log between Hossein's Cowork strategist (Claude in Cowork mode) and the Claude Code terminal agent executing work on `feat/mechanic-mot-ux-2026-04-20` and successor branches. Replaces copy-paste of prompts and reports.

**Protocol.**
- Append-only. Never edit past entries. Corrections go in a new entry.
- Every entry starts with `## [ROLE] YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM — one-line summary` where `ROLE` is `STRATEGIST` or `AGENT`.
- STRATEGIST entries contain the prompt the terminal agent should execute next.
- AGENT entries contain the checkpoint report (what shipped, commit SHAs, test counts, surprises, stop-reason).
- Both sides read the whole tail on every turn — no skipping.
- The terminal agent must stop at every strategist-defined checkpoint and append its report here before waiting. The strategist then appends the next prompt.
- Keep entries self-contained: commit SHAs, file paths, test counts, any deviations from the written plan.
- Timezone: UK local (Dudley).

## [STRATEGIST] 2026-04-20 21:45 — Step 2a: Add part + Request approval (split confirmed)

Greenlight **Option A — split Step 2 into 2a and 2b**. Explicit sign-off on both divergences from the written fix plan:

1. **Wrap `addJobPart` not `addCharge`.** Your reasoning is correct — §4.5 requires the stock/supplier/receipt-upload audit trail, and `addCharge` bypasses it. Update `docs/redesign/MECHANIC_MOT_FIX_PLAN_2026-04-20.md` with a one-line correction so future sessions don't re-hit this fork.
2. **Split scope.** 2a = Add part + Request approval (no migrations). 2b = Add note (migration 050 + RPC + timeline view UNION + customer-labels + ALLOWED_TABLES + RLS tests) — parked for next session.

**Step 2a — execute now:**

- Create `src/app/(app)/app/tech/job/[id]/AddPartSheet.tsx` — shadcn `Sheet` (right on desktop via `useMediaQuery`, bottom on mobile), wraps `addJobPart` server action. Form fields per §4.5: part name, supplier (from `suppliers` list), qty, unit cost, optional receipt upload (10 MB, magic-byte-checked per rule #9).
- Create `src/app/(app)/app/tech/job/[id]/RequestApprovalSheet.tsx` — same Sheet shape, wraps the existing approval action. Fields per §4.4: summary, estimated cost, optional photo, sends signed HMAC SMS link (rule #7) via the existing Twilio path.
- Create `src/app/(app)/app/tech/job/[id]/TechSecondaryActions.tsx` — 3-column grid, Button `size="lg"` (44 px min, WCAG 2.5.5). Third slot is **grey-disabled with "Coming soon" tooltip** for Add note (Option C flavour inside 2a so the visual shape is final).
- Edit `TechJobClient.tsx` ~L227 (between timer card and Pause/Complete row): insert `<TechSecondaryActions>` gated on `isWorking`. Leave the L92 pre-existing lint error alone — it's in the housekeeping backlog.
- Edit `tech/[id]/page.tsx` to pass `suppliers` + any other props the Sheets need.

**Tests (2a, unit only — no new RLS surface):**
- `tests/unit/tech-secondary-actions-addpart.test.tsx` — renders Sheet, validates form, asserts `addJobPart` called with correct shape.
- `tests/unit/tech-secondary-actions-requestapproval.test.tsx` — same shape for Request approval.
- `tests/unit/tech-secondary-actions-layout.test.tsx` — 3-column grid, disabled state on Add note slot, correct button sizes.

**Before coding, confirm in your next AGENT_LOG entry:**
- Which action powers Request approval today? (`charges/actions.ts` → `requestApproval`? or elsewhere?) — name the exact function + file.
- Are there existing RLS tests that already cover `addJobPart` writes? If yes, no new RLS tests needed for 2a. If no, flag and the strategist will decide whether to add them to 2a or defer.

**Checkpoint (stop here, append AGENT report):**
- 221/221 unit green, typecheck clean, `pnpm lint:spacing` clean, vibe-security audit clean.
- One commit on `feat/mechanic-mot-ux-2026-04-20`, summary line + body explaining the 2a/2b split and the `addJobPart` correction.
- Report: what shipped, commit SHA, test counts, any surprises, stop-reason.

Do not start 2b. Do not touch Steps 3–17 yet.

## [AGENT] 2026-04-20 22:30 — Step 2a shipped (commit 6934915)

**What shipped:**
- `AddPartSheet.tsx` — wraps `addJobPart(formData)` from `parts/actions.ts`. Mobile-bottom / desktop-right sheet via `useMediaQuery("(max-width: 639px)")`. Fields per §4.5: supplier dropdown with conditional `supplierOther`, description, qty, unit price in pounds (converted client-side to pence), payment method, optional receipt upload with `capture="environment"`. Server-side magic-byte + size validation unchanged (Rule #9).
- `RequestApprovalSheet.tsx` — wraps `requestApproval({jobId, description, amountPence})` from `approvals/actions.ts`. Same sheet shape. HMAC-signed SMS link (Rule #7) + status flip to `awaiting_customer_approval` unchanged.
- `TechSecondaryActions.tsx` — 3-column grid, `size="lg"` + `min-h-11` (WCAG 2.5.5). Add-note slot is a disabled button with Base-UI `Tooltip` showing "Coming soon".
- `TechJobClient.tsx` — row inserted between timer card and Pause/Complete, gated on `isWorking`.
- Fix-plan doc updated in-place with the `addJobPart` vs `addCharge` correction.

**Test + lint state:**
- `pnpm typecheck` — clean
- `pnpm lint` — 4 errors, same pre-existing set (`customers:77`, `PartRow:48 ×2`, `TechJobClient:93` drifted from `:92` by one new import line, same rule + same file)
- `pnpm lint:spacing` — clean
- `pnpm test:unit` — 228/228 (+8 vs prior 220)
- Push: `565964e..6934915 feat/mechanic-mot-ux-2026-04-20`

**Parked for 2b (explicit):** migration 050 for `public.job_notes` + RLS + REPLICA IDENTITY FULL + `supabase_realtime` publication add; SECURITY DEFINER RPC `public.insert_job_note(job_id, body)` per Rule #3 + #8; `addJobNote` server action; UNION entry in `job_timeline_events` view; `ALLOWED_TABLES` + `realtime_publication.test.ts` whitelist additions; RLS tests (garage wall, INSERT-without-assignment reject, UPDATE own-notes-only, SELECT visibility); customer-labels decision (probably exclude notes from public status timeline — strategist to confirm); replace the disabled placeholder with real `AddNoteSheet`.

**Surprises / divergences worth naming:**
1. **`@base-ui/react` vs Radix.** Codebase's `SheetTrigger` + `TooltipTrigger` use Base-UI's `render={<Button/>}` pattern, not Radix's `asChild`. Typechecked red on three files on first attempt; fixed across all three in-iteration. Non-obvious — worth remembering for later sheet-creating steps.
2. **`ApprovalDialog.tsx` on manager is inline expansion, not modal.** My sheet follows the fix plan's sheet-on-tech pattern explicitly, not the manager's pattern. Not a regression — intentional surface divergence.
3. **Housekeeping flag (NEW):** `job_parts_insert` WITH CHECK is missing the `jobs.garage_id = job_parts.garage_id` consistency check — same bug class as the `work_logs` gap migration 049 closed. Not fixing in 2a; surfaced for strategist triage.

**F2 status:** partial close — two of three sheets shipped, Add-note disabled-placeholder in place, 2b tracked. F4 sizing comply (all new buttons `size="lg"`, `min-h-11`).

Stopped. Not starting 2b. Not touching Steps 3–17.

## [STRATEGIST] 2026-04-20 22:35 — Migration 050: close `job_parts` RLS write-side gap before Step 3

Good close on 2a. Before we start Step 3, close the `job_parts` RLS gap you just flagged — same bug class as migration 049, same fix pattern, stand-alone commit.

**Why now, not later:**
- CLAUDE.md rule #3 is non-negotiable ("RLS on every public table, always") — a known missing tenant-consistency check in a write-side WITH CHECK is a rule violation, not a deferrable nit.
- We already proved the pattern with migration 049 on `work_logs`. Cheaper to stamp out the same class while it's fresh than to do a housekeeping sweep at Phase 4.
- Step 3 work won't touch `job_parts` RLS, so this commit is cleanly scoped and reviewable on its own.

**Scope — migration 050 (`supabase/migrations/050_p51_job_parts_check_assignment_and_job_tenant.sql`):**

Mirror the migration 049 shape on `job_parts` INSERT + UPDATE policies:

```sql
alter policy "job_parts_insert" on public.job_parts
  with check (
    garage_id = private.current_garage()
    and exists (
      select 1 from public.jobs j
      where j.id = job_parts.job_id
        and j.garage_id = job_parts.garage_id
    )
    and (
      private.is_staff_or_manager()
      or exists (
        select 1 from public.job_assignments ja
        where ja.job_id = job_parts.job_id
          and ja.staff_id = auth.uid()
      )
    )
  );

-- same two predicates appended to job_parts_update WITH CHECK
```

Match the exact predicate ordering and comment style used in 049 so a future reader can `diff` them side-by-side.

**Tests:**
- Append to the existing `tests/rls/job_parts.test.ts` (or create it if it doesn't exist yet — follow the `work_logs.test.ts` shape from the 049 PR):
  - Cross-garage INSERT reject — assignee in garage A tries to write `job_parts` row with `garage_id = B`, expect policy reject.
  - Cross-garage UPDATE reject — same shape on UPDATE.
  - Non-assignee non-manager INSERT reject — mechanic who is not on `job_assignments` for the target job, expect policy reject.
  - Assignee INSERT accept — happy-path regression guard.
  - Manager INSERT accept — manager bypass via `is_staff_or_manager()` happy path.

Target RLS test count: 98 → 103 (or equivalent +5 depending on current count).

**Spot-check before you start:**

Run this against the rest of the domain-table INSERT/UPDATE policies — grep for any WITH CHECK that references `garage_id = private.current_garage()` but does NOT also have a `jobs.garage_id = <this_table>.garage_id` join. Name the findings in your AGENT entry. Candidates worth checking: `job_status_events`, `job_passbacks`, `job_charges`, `job_approvals`, `work_logs` (should already be fixed by 049 — confirm), `invoices`, `approval_tokens`. **Do not fix anything else in this commit** — just list findings for the strategist. Migration 050 stays `job_parts`-only so the diff reads clean.

**Checkpoint (stop here, append AGENT report):**
- Migration 050 applied locally + RLS tests green.
- Full suite: typecheck clean, `pnpm lint:spacing` clean, `pnpm test:unit` still 228+/228+, `pnpm test:rls` ≥ 103.
- Vibe-security audit: re-run on the backend surface touched by 050 (policies.md + database-security.md reference). Clean.
- One commit on `feat/mechanic-mot-ux-2026-04-20`, pushed.
- Report:
  - Commit SHA.
  - Test counts.
  - List of other domain tables with the same bug class (findings only — no fix in this commit).
  - Any surprises.

Do not start Step 3. Do not start 2b. Do not touch other tables' RLS policies.

## [AGENT] 2026-04-21 01:35 — Migration 050 shipped + domain-table audit findings

**What shipped (commit pending push at time of writing — SHA in final paragraph):**
- `supabase/migrations/050_p51_job_parts_check_assignment_and_job_tenant.sql` — `ALTER POLICY` on both `job_parts_insert` and `job_parts_update`, mirroring migration 049's shape on `work_logs`. Both WITH CHECKs now require: `garage_id = current_garage()` + `added_by = auth.uid()` + `EXISTS jobs j WHERE j.garage_id = job_parts.garage_id` (the new cross-tenant consistency check) + `is_staff_or_manager() OR EXISTS job_assignments`. USING clauses unchanged. Full header comment documents the gap class, the bypass widening (see below), and the symmetric treatment vs 049.
- `tests/rls/job_parts.test.ts` — new file, 6 cases:
  1. Assigned mechanic CAN insert on assigned job (regression guard)
  2. Manager CAN insert on any job in garage (is_staff_or_manager bypass)
  3. Non-assignee mechanic CANNOT insert on unassigned job in own garage → 42501
  4. Cross-tenant insert rejected (B mechanic pointing at A's job) → 42501
  5. Cross-tenant UPDATE rejected — B manager can't mutate A-garage row (rowCount=0 via USING)
  6. mot_tester can SELECT via is_staff_or_manager regression guard
- Also landed in this commit: **two typecheck errors from Step 2a that the `tsconfig.tsbuildinfo` build cache masked during the 2a checkpoint**. All 5 `.form!` access sites on `screen.getByRole(...)` were erroring under a fresh `tsc --noEmit`; cast to `HTMLButtonElement` to fix. Mine-to-carry since they were introduced by 2a — rolling into this commit so the 050 push state is clean rather than leaving a known-red typecheck on the branch head.

**Test + lint state:**
- `pnpm typecheck` — clean (was red on stale cache; fixed in this commit)
- `pnpm lint` — 4 errors, same pre-existing set (customers:77, PartRow:48 ×2, TechJobClient:93)
- `pnpm lint:spacing` — clean
- `pnpm test:unit` — 228/228
- `pnpm test:rls` — **104/104** (was 98, +6 new cases all green)

**Behavior-change note on migration 050's INSERT bypass:**
The pre-050 `job_parts_insert` WITH CHECK was `... AND (private.is_manager() OR EXISTS job_assignments)`. Migration 050 widens this to `private.is_staff_or_manager()` (= manager OR mot_tester) to match the migration 049 shape exactly and keep the two policies diffable side-by-side. In practice this grants a mot_tester-only session the same INSERT bypass as a manager — which matches the "mot_tester is staff, not a tech" mental model already baked into the existing `is_staff_or_manager()` helper. Mechanics still need a `job_assignments` row (unchanged behaviour). If strategist wanted to preserve the tighter manager-only bypass, that would be a follow-up migration 051 — easy to add, just name it.

**Domain-table audit findings (spot-check per strategist's ask — findings only, no fixes in this commit):**

| Table | Policy | WITH CHECK predicate | Gap class |
|---|---|---|---|
| `work_logs` | insert + update | `garage_id = current_garage() AND staff_id = auth.uid() AND EXISTS jobs-tenant AND (is_staff_or_manager OR assignment)` | ✅ fixed by migration 049 — confirmed |
| `job_parts` | insert + update | tightened in migration 050 — see above | ✅ fixed by migration 050 |
| `job_charges` | insert | `garage_id = (SELECT staff.garage_id FROM staff WHERE staff.id = auth.uid())` | ❌ **Gap.** No `job_id`-to-garage consistency check. Also uses a staff-subquery form rather than `private.current_garage()` — different shape from every other policy in the repo. Worth normalising. |
| `job_charges` | update | **NULL WITH CHECK** | ❌ **Gap.** CLAUDE.md Rule #3 explicitly requires `WITH CHECK` on every UPDATE policy; missing = silent permissive. Real CI-catchable rule violation. |
| `invoices` | insert | `garage_id = (SELECT staff.garage_id FROM staff WHERE staff.id = auth.uid())` | ❌ **Gap.** Same staff-subquery shape. `invoices` is job-adjacent (1 invoice ↔ 1 job); a cross-tenant check would be `EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM jobs j WHERE j.id = invoices.job_id AND j.garage_id = invoices.garage_id)` if the FK exists — needs confirming. |
| `invoices` | update | **NULL WITH CHECK** | ❌ **Gap.** Same Rule #3 violation as `job_charges`. |
| `approval_requests` | insert | `garage_id = current_garage() AND requested_by = auth.uid()` | ❌ **Gap.** No `job_id`-to-garage consistency check. Same class as 049/050. |
| `approval_requests` | update | (not surfaced by the spot-check query — either absent or manager-only) | Worth a follow-up audit to confirm. |
| `job_assignments` | insert | `garage_id = current_garage() AND is_manager()` | ❌ **Gap.** Manager-only insert, no `job_id`-to-garage check. Manager in garage A could in theory assign garage-A staff to a garage-B `job_id` if the UUID leaked — unlikely in practice but same class. |
| `job_assignments` | update | (not surfaced — likely manager-only or absent) | Worth confirming. |
| `job_passbacks` | **SELECT only** | no INSERT/UPDATE policy exists | ✅ SECURITY DEFINER-only writes via P51 RPCs — explicit tightest posture. Not a gap. |
| `job_status_events` | **SELECT only** | no INSERT/UPDATE policy exists | ✅ Same posture — writes only via the P54 `set_job_status` RPC. Not a gap. |
| `job_approvals` | — | table doesn't exist | — (the strategist's candidate list used the wrong name; real table is `approval_requests`). |

**Net of findings:** 5 tables still have the same class of gap (`job_charges` ×2, `invoices` ×2, `approval_requests`, `job_assignments`), plus two of them (`job_charges_update`, `invoices_update`) have the sharper Rule #3 "missing WITH CHECK on UPDATE" violation. Recommend a migration-051 / migration-052 pair to close them before Phase 4 deploy. Not fixing in this commit per scope rule.

**Surprises:**
1. **Staff-subquery form on `job_charges_insert` + `invoices_insert`** — different shape from every other policy (which all use `private.current_garage()`). Shouldn't matter functionally because `private.current_garage()` ultimately reads the same staff row, but it's one more mental model to hold. Housekeeping normalisation candidate.
2. **Stale `tsconfig.tsbuildinfo` masked the Step 2a typecheck errors.** I reported "typecheck clean" at the 2a checkpoint based on a cached build. Fresh `tsc --noEmit` after 050 applied caught five `HTMLElement.form` errors. Fixed in this commit but worth flagging that `tsc` caching is sneaky on this repo — CI would have caught it; local solo runs may not.
3. **`job_approvals` doesn't exist** — strategist's candidate list named it. Real table is `approval_requests`. Noted.

**Commit + push:** about to stage, commit, and push. SHA below after push completes.

— stop reason: reached the strategist-defined checkpoint. Not starting Step 3 or 2b.

## [AGENT] 2026-04-21 01:37 — Correction: migration 050 SHA

Prior entry said "SHA below after push completes" — filling in: commit `1ddf757`, pushed to `oplaris/feat/mechanic-mot-ux-2026-04-20` (range `6934915..1ddf757`). No content correction; metadata-only.

## [STRATEGIST] 2026-04-21 09:15 — Migration 051 (NULL WITH CHECK fix) + hardening doc, then Step 3

Good close on 050. Three rulings on the surfaces you raised:

**1. `is_staff_or_manager()` bypass widening on `job_parts` — ACCEPTED.**
Consistency with migration 049's shape outweighs the tighter manager-only bypass. No migration-051-style revert. The helper rename (`is_staff_or_manager` excludes mechanic despite name) stays in the housekeeping backlog — will be addressed in the pre-Phase-4 hardening sweep. Document this decision in the new hardening doc below.

**2. Stale `tsconfig.tsbuildinfo` masking 2a typecheck errors — ACCEPTED as protocol update.**
Good catch + good self-correction rolling the fix into the 050 commit. Protocol tightening for all future checkpoints in this log:
- Every checkpoint typecheck must be run from a cold cache: `rm -rf .next tsconfig.tsbuildinfo && pnpm typecheck`
- Same discipline for `pnpm test:unit --no-cache` where the runner supports it.
- If a stale-cache regression is discovered after a checkpoint, it rolls into the next commit + gets flagged in the AGENT entry — do not silently re-report "clean" after the fact.

**3. Domain-table audit findings — DECISION: split into "now" (migration 051) and "later" (pre-Phase-4 hardening doc).**

Your audit surfaced two severity tiers:
- **Sharper (Rule #3 literal violation):** `job_charges_update` and `invoices_update` have NULL WITH CHECK. CLAUDE.md Rule #3 explicitly requires WITH CHECK on every UPDATE policy. Missing = silent permissive. A mechanic/manager with SELECT access can UPDATE any column to any value. Cannot defer.
- **Weaker (same class as 049/050):** `job_charges_insert`, `invoices_insert`, `approval_requests_insert`, `job_assignments_insert` missing `job_id`→garage consistency check. Exploit requires cross-tenant UUID leak + staff creds in target garage. Batch-able pre-Phase-4.

**Your next task has two commits, then Step 3:**

---

**Commit A — migration 051 (`supabase/migrations/051_p51_job_charges_invoices_update_withcheck.sql`):**

Add WITH CHECK to the `job_charges_update` and `invoices_update` policies. Minimum-viable predicate — **match the shape used on the table's existing INSERT policy WITH CHECK** (so the diff stays minimal) plus the `job_id`→garage consistency check pattern from 049/050:

```sql
alter policy "job_charges_update" on public.job_charges
  with check (
    garage_id = (select staff.garage_id from public.staff where staff.id = auth.uid())
    and exists (
      select 1 from public.jobs j
      where j.id = job_charges.job_id
        and j.garage_id = job_charges.garage_id
    )
  );

alter policy "invoices_update" on public.invoices
  with check (
    garage_id = (select staff.garage_id from public.staff where staff.id = auth.uid())
    and exists (
      select 1 from public.jobs j
      where j.id = invoices.job_id
        and j.garage_id = invoices.garage_id
    )
  );
```

**Note:** preserving the staff-subquery form on these two tables because migration 051 is a **rule-compliance fix, not a normalisation migration**. Rewriting the predicate style into `private.current_garage()` is part of the pre-Phase-4 hardening sweep — out of scope here. Header comment in 051 must call this out explicitly so a future reader doesn't "clean it up" by accident.

**Tests — append to (or create) `tests/rls/job_charges.test.ts` + `tests/rls/invoices.test.ts`:**
- `job_charges_update`: cross-tenant UPDATE reject (A-garage mechanic tries to mutate B-garage charge via direct UPDATE SQL) → rowCount = 0 / 42501.
- `job_charges_update`: same-tenant happy-path regression guard (manager UPDATEs own-garage charge succeeds).
- `invoices_update`: cross-tenant UPDATE reject.
- `invoices_update`: same-tenant happy-path regression guard.

Target RLS count: 104 → 108.

**Commit B — create `docs/redesign/PRE_PHASE_4_HARDENING.md`:**

New living doc tracking everything we've deferred to the pre-Phase-4 hardening sweep. Initial content:

```markdown
# PRE_PHASE_4_HARDENING.md

Living queue of hygiene items to close before Phase 4 (deploy) cutover.
Nothing in here is a showstopper for ongoing feature work — but nothing in
here ships to production without being addressed.

## RLS — write-side gaps (same class as migration 049 on work_logs / 050 on job_parts)

| Table | Policy | Gap | Fix shape |
|---|---|---|---|
| `job_charges` | insert | Missing `EXISTS jobs j WHERE j.id = job_charges.job_id AND j.garage_id = job_charges.garage_id` | Mirror 050 INSERT shape |
| `invoices` | insert | Same | Mirror 050 INSERT shape |
| `approval_requests` | insert | Same | Mirror 050 INSERT shape |
| `job_assignments` | insert | Manager-only today but still no job_id→garage check | Mirror 050 INSERT shape, keep manager-only gate |

Migration target: `052_p51_phase4_hardening_sweep.sql` (single migration, grouped for reviewability).
Tests: one `tests/rls/{table}.test.ts` per table, matching the `job_parts.test.ts` structure. Target +8–10 RLS tests.

## RLS — predicate-style normalisation

`job_charges_insert`, `job_charges_update`, `invoices_insert`, `invoices_update` use the staff-subquery form
`garage_id = (SELECT staff.garage_id FROM staff WHERE staff.id = auth.uid())` rather than
`private.current_garage()`. Functionally equivalent but inconsistent with every other policy in the repo.
Normalise in the hardening sweep (migration 052 or 053) — diff-only, no behaviour change, but makes auditing
easier.

## Naming — `private.is_staff_or_manager()`

Helper is misnamed: it returns TRUE for manager + mot_tester, FALSE for mechanic. Rename to something
accurate (`private.is_manager_or_mot_tester()`? `private.has_non_mechanic_staff_role()`?) during the
hardening sweep. Currently referenced by `work_logs` (migration 049) and `job_parts` (migration 050) INSERT
policies. Rename → find/replace all callers → re-run full RLS suite.

## Migration hygiene

- Consolidate letter-suffix migration files (pre-existing `033b_p51_gdpr_export.sql` + any 026-era fallout)
  into pure-numeric prefixes. Supabase CLI's migration regex silently skips letter suffixes — this has
  already cost one debugging session.
- Add a CI guard: reject any migration file whose prefix doesn't match `^[0-9]{3,}_[a-z0-9_]+\.sql$`.

## Typecheck cache discipline (process)

Every checkpoint typecheck is run from cold cache: `rm -rf .next tsconfig.tsbuildinfo && pnpm typecheck`.
Any regression caught post-checkpoint rolls into the next commit + gets flagged in the AGENT_LOG entry.

## Known minors from main (not hardening but worth logging)

- 4 pre-existing lint errors: `customers:77`, `PartRow:48 ×2`, `TechJobClient:93` (react-hooks/set-state-in-effect).
- `TechAssignmentModal.tsx:69` — same bug class as Step 1's self-start redirect fix, not yet applied there.

## Deferred from Phase 3

- `job_approvals` was named in a strategist prompt but doesn't exist; real table is `approval_requests`.
  No fix — just archaeological note.
```

Keep the doc concise. It's a queue, not a design doc.

**Checkpoint after both commits (stop here, append AGENT report):**
- Migration 051 applied locally.
- Full suite: cold-cache typecheck clean, `pnpm lint:spacing` clean, `pnpm test:unit` ≥ 228/228, `pnpm test:rls` ≥ 108/108.
- `PRE_PHASE_4_HARDENING.md` committed.
- Both commits pushed on `feat/mechanic-mot-ux-2026-04-20`.
- Report commit SHAs, test counts, any surprises.

Do not start Step 3 yet. Do not touch the deferred hardening items. Do not start 2b.

## [AGENT] 2026-04-21 01:50 — Migration 051 + hardening doc shipped

**What shipped (two commits, this AGENT entry will be a third log-only commit after push):**

- **Commit A — `1832f22`** `fix(rls): migration 051 — job_charges + invoices UPDATE WITH CHECK`
  - `supabase/migrations/051_p51_job_charges_invoices_update_withcheck.sql` — ALTER POLICY on both `job_charges_update` and `invoices_update`, mirroring each table's INSERT predicate (the staff-subquery garage-wall) + appending the `job_id`→garage consistency check from 049/050. USING clauses unchanged. DELETE policies untouched. Verbatim SQL from strategist prompt; header comment documents the deliberate-scope-preservation decision so a future reader doesn't "normalise" the staff-subquery predicate style by accident.
  - `tests/rls/job_charges.test.ts` (new) — 2 cases: same-tenant manager UPDATE succeeds (regression guard); cross-tenant B-manager UPDATE → rowCount=0 (USING silently rejects before WITH CHECK fires; either outcome proves RLS intact).
  - `tests/rls/invoices.test.ts` (new) — mirror pair for invoices.

- **Commit B — `c4e706c`** `docs: pre-Phase-4 hardening queue`
  - `docs/redesign/PRE_PHASE_4_HARDENING.md` (new) — content verbatim from the strategist's spec. Tracks: 4 remaining write-side RLS gaps (migration 052 target), predicate-style normalisation, `is_staff_or_manager` helper rename, letter-suffix migration consolidation + CI guard, cold-cache typecheck discipline, 4 pre-existing lint errors, `TechAssignmentModal.tsx:69` redirect bug, archaeological note on `job_approvals`.

**Push:** `b11d8fa..c4e706c feat/mechanic-mot-ux-2026-04-20`.

**Suite state (cold-cache discipline applied per new protocol):**
- `rm -rf .next tsconfig.tsbuildinfo && pnpm typecheck` — clean
- `pnpm lint` — 4 errors (all pre-existing housekeeping set — customers:77, PartRow:48 ×2, TechJobClient:93)
- `pnpm lint:spacing` — clean
- `pnpm test:unit` — 228/228
- `pnpm test:rls` — **108/108** (was 104, +4 new cases: job_charges ×2, invoices ×2)

**Surprises / observations:**
1. **Cold-cache typecheck passed first attempt.** The stale-cache protocol discipline is now baked into the commit flow; no phantom errors surfaced when I blew away `.next` + `tsconfig.tsbuildinfo` this time. Good sanity check that Step 2a's 5 `HTMLElement.form` sites were genuinely fixed in the 050 commit, not just cache-masked back to clean.
2. **Cross-tenant UPDATE semantics — silent no-op, not 42501.** When B-manager tries to UPDATE an A-garage row, USING (garage_id = B) filters the row out before WITH CHECK can fire. `UPDATE ... WHERE job_id = A_JOB` returns `rowCount = 0`, not an error. Test asserts rowCount=0 rather than `.rejects.toMatchObject({ code: "42501" })` — matches the Postgres RLS behaviour accurately. Documented in the test comment.
3. **`asSuperuser` has no implicit transaction.** Seeds from `asSuperuser` persist across tests by default — mirrors how fixtures.ts seeds the baseline. Each test here uses `afterEach` to DELETE its own seed rows to prevent carryover. Pattern matches the `job_parts.test.ts` approach from migration 050.
4. **No new `ALLOWED_TABLES` whitelist update needed.** `job_charges` and `invoices` are already on `supabase_realtime` publication (confirmed by the unchanged `realtime_publication.test.ts` pass). Migration 051 only touches policies, not replication.

**Deferred (tracked in PRE_PHASE_4_HARDENING.md):**
- Migration 052 sweep: 4 write-side INSERT gaps + predicate-style normalisation.
- `is_staff_or_manager()` helper rename.
- Letter-suffix migration consolidation + CI guard.
- 4 pre-existing lint errors.
- `TechAssignmentModal.tsx:69` redirect.

— stop reason: reached the strategist-defined checkpoint. Not starting Step 3. Not starting 2b. Not touching the hardening items.

## [STRATEGIST] 2026-04-21 09:45 — Step 3: Pass-back context card on tech view

Good close on 051 + hardening doc. Two of the three observations ACCEPTED:
- Cold-cache protocol working — continue the discipline.
- Cross-tenant UPDATE silent-no-op pattern — add a one-liner to the hardening doc's "RLS test conventions" section in a **separate follow-up commit** (not part of Step 3): "When asserting cross-tenant UPDATE rejection, assert `rowCount === 0` — USING filters before WITH CHECK, so `UPDATE` returns no-rows, not error 42501." Keeps future RLS tests consistent.
- Realtime publication observation — filed, no action.

**Now execute Step 3 from `docs/redesign/MECHANIC_MOT_FIX_PLAN_2026-04-20.md`.**

**Goal (plain English):** when a mechanic opens `/app/tech/job/[id]` and that job has an unreturned `job_passbacks` row, render a read-only card above the timer showing the ticked items as amber chips + the free-text note + who passed it back and when. Mechanic sees the MOT's flagged issues the moment they open the job.

**Files:**
- `src/app/(app)/app/tech/job/[id]/page.tsx` — fetch the latest open `job_passbacks` row (if any), conditionally render `<PassbackContextCard>` above `<TechJobClient>`.
- **New:** `src/app/(app)/app/tech/job/[id]/PassbackContextCard.tsx` — RSC (no interactivity needed), display-only. Takes `{ items, note, createdAt, fromRole }` props.
- `src/lib/constants/passback-items.ts` — already has the label map; reuse.
- `src/components/ui/passback-badge.tsx` — reuse for the header accent.
- `src/components/ui/section.tsx` — use the `<Section title=…>` primitive for the H2 (screen-reader semantics required by DoD).
- `src/components/ui/badge.tsx` — reuse for the ticked-item chips (`variant="secondary"` with amber tint matching `PassbackBadge`).

**Fetch shape (in page.tsx RSC):**

```ts
const { data: pb } = await supabase
  .from("job_passbacks")
  .select("items, note, created_at, from_role")
  .eq("job_id", jobId)
  .is("returned_at", null)
  .order("created_at", { ascending: false })
  .limit(1)
  .maybeSingle();
```

Render the card only when:
```ts
pb && session.roles.includes("mechanic")
```
The MOT tester who created the pass-back doesn't need to see their own echo back. Multi-role staff (mot_tester + mechanic) still see it because `roles` is an array. Manager-only views don't get it — they use `/app/jobs/[id]` for oversight.

**Card layout — use existing primitives (no new hardcoded classes):**

```tsx
<Section title="Passed back from MOT" description={`${timeSincePassback} · from ${fromRoleLabel}`}>
  <PassbackBadge variant="…" />  {/* match existing usage */}
  <div className="flex flex-wrap gap-2">
    {items.map(item => (
      <Badge key={item} variant="secondary" className="bg-warning/15 text-warning-foreground">
        {PASSBACK_ITEMS_LABELS[item] ?? item}
      </Badge>
    ))}
  </div>
  {note ? (
    <blockquote className="mt-3 border-l-2 border-warning/40 pl-3 text-sm text-muted-foreground">
      {note}
    </blockquote>
  ) : null}
</Section>
```

**Time formatting — pick the right helper:**

The fix plan mentions `formatWorkLogTime` but that's a duration formatter (P44). `created_at` is an absolute timestamp. Use whichever of `src/lib/format.ts`'s absolute-time helpers is canonical — likely `formatRelativeTime` or `formatDateTime`. If neither fits cleanly, reuse what `JobActivity`/`job_timeline_events` surface uses for event timestamps (that's the P54 consistency anchor). Name the chosen helper in your AGENT report.

**Contrast / a11y — non-negotiable:**

- The amber chip tint (`bg-warning/15 text-warning-foreground`) must pass AA (4.5:1). If it doesn't under current tokens, switch to `text-foreground` on the chip — do NOT introduce a new colour. Same rule flagged in Step 6 of the fix plan for `text-warning`.
- `<Section title>` provides the `<h2>`. Confirm the rendered DOM has an actual `<h2>` (not a `<div>` styled like one).
- `<blockquote>` is semantic; don't swap for a styled `<div>`.

**Visibility rule — code the mechanic-only gate on the server.**

Do the `session.roles.includes("mechanic")` check in `page.tsx` (RSC) before rendering the card, not inside `PassbackContextCard`. If the mechanic gate is false, don't fetch the row at all — save the query. Render shape:

```tsx
const hasMechanicRole = session.roles.includes("mechanic");
const pb = hasMechanicRole ? await fetchOpenPassback(...) : null;
return (
  <>
    {pb ? <PassbackContextCard {...pb} /> : null}
    <TechJobClient … />
  </>
);
```

**Realtime — rely on existing shim, don't add a new one.**

If the pass-back gets returned while the mechanic is on this page, the card should disappear. `job_passbacks` is already in the `supabase_realtime` publication + `ALLOWED_TABLES` whitelist (migration 035/036). `JobDetailRealtime` or `TechJobClient`'s existing realtime call triggers `router.refresh()`, which re-runs the RSC fetch above. Verify by grepping — if the tech job page already subscribes to `job_passbacks` changes, no code change needed. If it doesn't, add `job_passbacks` to the existing `useRealtimeRouterRefresh` call's table list. Do not create a new channel.

**Tests:**
- `tests/unit/passback-context-card.test.tsx` (new) — snapshot + prop-driven render:
  - 3-item pass-back with a note renders 3 chips + blockquote.
  - Empty `note` → no blockquote rendered.
  - Unknown item key falls back to the raw string (defensive).
  - `<h2>` is present in the DOM (assertion, not snapshot-only).
- RLS: run `tests/rls/job_passbacks.test.ts` and confirm it already has "mechanic assigned to job CAN SELECT the passback row." If missing, add it (name the test in the AGENT report). Should NOT require a new migration.
- No E2E spec — fix plan says "skipped E2E_STAGING_READY-gated"; don't add one here.

**Vibe-security — quick sanity check, not a full audit:**

- The `pb && roles.includes("mechanic")` gate is a **render concern only** — the real wall is the `job_passbacks` SELECT RLS policy. Document this reasoning in the commit message body. A user with a leaked mechanic session trying to read a cross-garage pass-back will still be blocked by RLS.
- No new server action, no new RPC, no new table, no new migration. If any of those turn up necessary during implementation, STOP and append an AGENT entry flagging the divergence before proceeding.

**Checkpoint (stop here, append AGENT report):**
- Cold-cache typecheck clean.
- `pnpm lint:spacing` clean.
- `pnpm test:unit` ≥ 229/229 (+1 minimum for the new snapshot file; the unit may include 3-4 cases).
- `pnpm test:rls` 108/108 or 109/109 if a new passback SELECT case was added.
- One commit on `feat/mechanic-mot-ux-2026-04-20`, pushed.
- Report:
  - Commit SHA.
  - Name of the absolute-time helper used + where it's imported from.
  - Realtime decision: did you rely on existing shim or add a new table to the existing hook call? Quote the file + line.
  - Any surprises.
  - Confirm the cross-tenant UPDATE one-liner for the hardening doc is NOT in this commit — if it is, flag the scope leak.

Do not start Step 4. Do not start 2b. Do not touch the hardening items.

## [AGENT] 2026-04-21 02:00 — Step 3 shipped (commit 31b955e)

**What shipped (one commit, pushed):**

- **`31b955e`** `fix(tech): pass-back context card on tech job view (F5)`
  - `src/app/(app)/app/tech/job/[id]/PassbackContextCard.tsx` (new) — display-only RSC. Takes `{items, note, createdAt, fromRole}`. Uses `<Section title>` for the h2 header + `<PassbackBadge>` chip + one shadcn `<Badge variant="secondary">` per ticked item + optional `<blockquote>` for the note. Unknown item keys fall back to the raw string.
  - `src/app/(app)/app/tech/job/[id]/page.tsx` — fetch the latest open `job_passbacks` row inside the RSC, gated server-side on `session.roles.includes("mechanic")` (skips the query entirely otherwise). Renders `<PassbackContextCard>` between the back-link and `<TechJobClient>`.
  - `tests/unit/passback-context-card.test.tsx` (new) — 6 cases: chips + blockquote, null-note no-blockquote, unknown-key fallback, h2 a11y assertion, from-role label, null-items defensive.
  - `tests/rls/job_passbacks.test.ts` (new) — 3 cases: assigned mechanic CAN SELECT open pass-back; same-garage mot_tester also CAN SELECT (no role gate on the policy); cross-tenant B mechanic gets rowCount=0. Existing `passback_rpcs.test.ts` covers the write RPCs but didn't exercise direct SELECT.

**Push:** `88766a3..31b955e feat/mechanic-mot-ux-2026-04-20`.

**Suite state (cold cache per protocol):**
- `rm -rf .next tsconfig.tsbuildinfo && pnpm typecheck` — clean
- `pnpm lint` — 4 errors (pre-existing housekeeping set: customers:77, PartRow:48 ×2, TechJobClient:93)
- `pnpm lint:spacing` — clean
- `pnpm test:unit` — **234/234** (+6)
- `pnpm test:rls` — **111/111** (+3)

**Strategist's checkpoint asks — answered:**

1. **Absolute-time helper used:** `formatWorkLogTime` from `src/lib/format.ts:14`. Despite the misleading "WorkLog" name, it IS the canonical absolute-time formatter used by `JobActivity` for unified-feed event timestamps (`JobActivity.tsx:168`, `:235`, `:259`). The duration formatter is the differently-named `formatWorkLogDuration` (`src/lib/format.ts:48`). The fix-plan note suggesting "formatWorkLogTime is a duration formatter (P44)" was incorrect — the helper formats `HH:mm:ss` for today, `DD MMM HH:mm:ss` otherwise. No naming refactor in scope here; logged as nothing-to-do.

2. **Realtime decision:** relied entirely on the existing shim. `JobDetailRealtime` already subscribes to `job_passbacks` filtered by job_id at `src/lib/realtime/shims.tsx:98` (`useRealtimeRouterRefresh({ table: "job_passbacks", filter: eqUuidFilter("job_id", jobId) })`). The page already mounts `<JobDetailRealtime jobId={job.id} />` at the top. When `returned_at` gets stamped on the row, the shim fires `router.refresh()`, the RSC re-runs the `is("returned_at", null)` query, returns null, and the card disappears. Zero new realtime code.

3. **Cross-tenant UPDATE one-liner for hardening doc — NOT in this commit.** Per strategist scope rule, the rowCount=0 RLS test convention note will land in a separate follow-up commit on the hardening doc. This commit is Step 3 only.

**Surprises / observations:**

1. **`job_passbacks_select` policy has NO role-or-assignment gate.** The RLS only checks `garage_id = current_garage() AND EXISTS jobs (matching tenant)`. ANY authenticated user in the garage — mechanic not assigned, mot_tester, manager — can read every pass-back row in the garage. That's intentional (passbacks are a P54 timeline source — broadly visible to staff) but means the mechanic-only render gate in `page.tsx` is purely a UX choice, not a security boundary. Documented in the commit message body and in the tests' "no role gate on the policy" comment.

2. **`tests/rls/job_passbacks.test.ts` did not exist.** Existing `tests/rls/passback_rpcs.test.ts` covered the four SECURITY DEFINER write RPCs but no direct SELECT through user-session RLS. New file fills that gap; named `job_passbacks.test.ts` to match the table-named convention used by `job_parts.test.ts`, `job_charges.test.ts`, `invoices.test.ts`.

3. **`page.tsx` ternary on the supabase `.from()` chain returns a bare `{ data: null }` when the gate is false.** Avoids `await`-ing on a Promise that doesn't exist + keeps the variable type stable. TypeScript narrows `openPassback` to `null` cleanly when `showPassback` is false, no extra type assertions needed. Pattern worth reusing for any future "skip-the-query-on-role" optimisations.

4. **`Badge variant="secondary"` with `bg-warning/15 text-foreground`.** The `text-warning-foreground` token is calibrated for solid `bg-warning` (~9:1) but fails AA on the `/15` shade. Switched to `text-foreground` per strategist's "no new colour, switch to text-foreground if needed" rule. Same fix shape that Step 6 of the fix plan flags for `text-warning` sites.

5. **Realtime shim already covers all 7 job-detail tables.** Reading `shims.tsx:93–104` while wiring this revealed the shim is comprehensive: jobs, work_logs, job_charges, job_parts, job_passbacks, approval_requests, invoices, job_assignments, job_status_events. Future steps that need realtime on the tech detail page should not add new hooks — extend the shim instead.

— stop reason: reached the strategist-defined checkpoint. Not starting Step 4 or 2b. Hardening items untouched.
